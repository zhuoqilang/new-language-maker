It's just a idea, for now.

It starts from a question: why don't people make a new language (natural language)?
Actually, it's a wrong question. Many people working or worked on it. But all these new languages are not vitality enough.

Rethinking from this, I believe there will be many new languages, its vitality depend on its benefit. In other words, why and how necessary you need a new language？

I think I need a new language, in which I can talk freely. There must be lots of other kind of benefit, and they will give birth to other new langueages. Some of them will grow up, who knows.
So it's necessary for a environment, which is helpful for a new language to be born.

“new-language-maker” is an environment.

First consider the case of a PC, using a standard keyboard input.

The environment includes input methods and has the functions like word association and spell checking. This requires everyone to have their own thesaurus.

There are two types of thesaurus, one of which is public, that is, everyone can selected and participate in the update. One is private which is shared and renewed only among a group of users who have recognized each other.

The former produces some "common language" and the latter produces "private language."

The above only considers vocabulary. If you need to develop grammar, the situation is hard to imagine. It is better not to develop a grammar, let the grammar generate itself, and then summarize it after a language is mature. Just like every existing natural language was born.

Consider a game in which players can communicate with each other using text entered by the keyboard. But the text you enter, in other people's eyes, is no longer the original, but is converted by some kind of algorithm, which means it looks garbled. But this garbled corresponds to the originally entered text, that is, the first person enters a certain word, and the other person seems to be a certain "garbled". Different people see different forms of garbled characters. This is similar to the information that everyone receives with their own private key. If the person enters this garbled back to the first person, the first person receives the word he originally entered.

The highest goal of the game is that players can communicate with each other. But first we have to choose a suitable algorithm to avoid it is easy to be reversed.

At this time, the creator needs to describe his new words, and the recipient has to learn to understand the meaning of the word (he does not see the original letter combination, but "garbled").

How to describe new words is difficult. In the case where there is no word shared by both parties. Need to have a suitable feedback mechanism.

In real life, this feedback mechanism comes from real life scenes. What should be in this game?
