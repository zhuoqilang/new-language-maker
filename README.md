# new-language-maker
2019-2-16:
It's just a idea, for now.
It starts from a question: why don't people make a new language (natural language)?
Actually, it's a wrong question. Many people working or worked on it. But all these new languages are not vitality enough.
Rethinking from this, I believe there will be many new languages, its vitality depend on its benefit. In other words, why and how necessary you need a new language？
I think I need a new language, in which I can talk freely. There must be lots of other kind of benefit, and they will give birth to other new langueages. Some of them will grow up, who knows.
So it's necessary for a environment, which is helpful for a new language to be born.

“new-language-maker” is an environment.
First consider the case of a PC, using a standard keyboard input.
The environment includes input methods and has the functions like word association and spell checking. This requires everyone to have their own thesaurus.
There are two types of thesaurus, one of which is public, that is, everyone can selected and participate in the update. One is private which is shared and renewed only among a group of users who have recognized each other.
The former produces some "common language" and the latter produces "private language."
The above only considers vocabulary. If you need to develop grammar, the situation is hard to imagine. It is better not to develop a grammar, let the grammar generate itself, and then summarize it after a language is mature. Just like every existing natural language was born.
