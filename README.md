# Alien Communicator

## Project Introduction

Alien Communicator is a web-based single page application designed to provide an experimental language communication environment, allowing users to communicate using a unique symbol system. This project stems from the exploration of language origins and the possibility of creating new languages.

### Project Origin

The project originated in 2019 with a simple question: why don't people create new natural languages? After some research, it was discovered that many people have worked on this, but most new languages lack vitality. The project evolved into an experiment to explore how new languages might emerge and gain vitality through a collaborative environment.

### Core Features

1. **Vocabulary Management**
   - Add and manage custom vocabulary
   - Each word automatically generates a unique 3-symbol combination
   - Support for adding word notes

2. **Contact Management**
   - Create and manage contact lists
   - Record basic information for each contact

3. **Communication Center**
   - Convert text messages to symbol sequences using vocabulary (encryption)
   - Convert received symbol sequences back to text (decryption)
   - Support for decryption through vocabulary and cracking notes

4. **Chat History**
   - Save communication history with each contact
   - Display original messages and converted symbol sequences

5. **Cracking Notes**
   - Record possible meanings of unknown symbols
   - Assist in the decryption process

### Technical Features

- Modern UI interface built with Tailwind CSS
- Data persistence using localStorage
- Communication system based on 16 unique symbols
- Fully client-side implementation, no backend server required

## Today's Discussion

- Confirmed GitHub Pages is activated, project accessible at https://zhuoqilang.github.io/new-language-maker/
- Renamed original HTML file to new-language-maker-V0.1.html as version record
- Discussed project upgrade plan, considering implementing basic user interaction through email list
- Created development log file to record project development process

## Future Plans

1. **User System Implementation**
   - Explore email-based user list management solution
   - Implement simple contact information sharing between users

2. **Feature Enhancement**
   - Optimize symbol generation algorithm to improve uniqueness
   - Add more custom symbol options
   - Improve message encryption and decryption mechanisms

3. **User Experience**
   - Add responsive design to support mobile devices
   - Optimize UI interface and interaction flow
   - Add usage tutorials and guidance

4. **Data Synchronization**
   - Explore cross-device data synchronization solutions
   - Consider introducing cloud storage options
