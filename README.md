It's just a idea, for now.
It starts from a question: why don't people make a new language (natural language)?
Actually, it's a wrong question. Many people working or worked on it. But all these new languages are not vitality enough.
Rethinking from this, I believe there will be many new languages, its vitality depend on its benefit. In other words, why and how necessary you need a new languageï¼Ÿ
I think I need a new language, in which I can talk freely. There must be lots of other kind of benefit, and they will give birth to other new langueages. Some of them will grow up, who knows.
So it's necessary for a environment, which is helpful for a new language to be born.
